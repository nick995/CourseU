[X] I solemly swear that I wrote every line of code submitted as part
of this assignment (except that auto-generated by Django).

The most interesting thing I learned in this assignment was Everything about Back-end. I always want to learn what is the Back-end, and how it works. It was really interesting and fun to study views, forms, validation, and models.

The hardest thing in this assignment was everything. It was hard to create model since I need to think which one should be ForeignKey, which one should be able to deleted. Also in the views.py, I'm still so confused with handling with queries, and forms part.
